      <p class="pg-text mt-3 paragraph">One thing about my summer that I knew I wanted to do even before summer started was that I wanted to get a job somewhere. There are a couple reasons why, the first being that I wanted to start getting job experience to put on my future resum&#233;s. This would be a great first step in the workforce. The second reason is because I can have an early income source so I could start saving up for a car. I applied for multiple companies but not one of them accepted me, in fact only one of them even reached back out to me.</p>

      <p class="pg-text mt-3 paragraph">There was, however, a some jobs that I was able to take during the summer. One of them was being able to babysit my 4 year old sister. It wasn't too difficult, all I had to do is make sure she was fed and entertained while my dad was at work. It was my job to not let her have fruit snacks and Kool-aid for her 3 meals a day. Overall this experience wasn't too different from my day to day life and I would do it again for my dad.</p>

      <p class="pg-text mt-3 paragraph">Another job I was able to work at this summer was dog sitting. I was really excited about this one because it too wasn't a very difficult job for me, but I also got to spend time with some dogs. This summer specifically I watched the same person's dogs twice, since they wanted to go to multiple places for their vaccation. The dog's names were Hank, an old Boxer, and Bayley, the energetic puppy. My job was to put food in their bowls every morning, and other tasks around the house. It was a great experience and I wouldn't have changed a thing about it.</p>
